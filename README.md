Pre-processing:

For the pre-processing part, since our final result is CRNN model is not that useful, and we shouldn't use most preprocessing steps before using the AWS, GCP, or Azure, thus the only valueable part for pre processing is data type conversion. In order to run this code, you need to make sure you download the latest version of poppler. If you are using windows system, do remember to add the file into the system dir. You can google how to do this. If you are using Mac book, you can just download the poppler and run the code. 

However, if you want to repeat everything, you can run the preprocessing main file, and do remember to change parameters.
